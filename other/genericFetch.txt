- 1 - Create a new endpoint for my-ideal-data - that gets both the users data, and the ideal data]
- 2 - in index.page.js create a new function called getMyIdealData() that calls said endpoint, but besides that is modeled after getIdealData() and getMyData()
- 3 - set STORE.selCloset = ‘my-ideal’

- 4 - add another switch case to organizeData inside of etc.module.js for ‘my-ideal’
- 5 - said switch case would use data.ideal.length and data.my.length
in the past your routes were sending back [{},{},{}]
this new route would send back an object of arrays of objects
{my:[{},{},{}], ideal:[{},{},{}]}
